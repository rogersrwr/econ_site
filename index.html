                  <p class=" about_text">Originally touted as a way to be your own boss, make your own schedule, and have the freedom a normal job cannot provide, the impacts of gig work on workers and the economy is becoming clear.</p>
                  <p class=" about_text">To begin, let's take a look at the rise of gig work in the US. From 2017 to 2021, the number of gig workers rose from approximately 1 million to 5 million as per a study by the University of Chicago (graphic by CNN). For a variety of reasons, a growing number of Americans are reliant on gig work for either a primary or supplementary source of income. It should also be noted that researchers currently have difficulty tracking the exact amount of gig workers in the economy, with some potential reasons for this given in the same referenced study by the University of Chicago. This is something I will expand on later. Through this visualization, it seems that there has been an increasing demand for gig type work within the labor market.</p>

                     <p class="apps_text">The benefits of gig work are more widely known about, as the companies that own and operate these gig apps constantly push these as selling points in their advertisements to get more workers. However, there are also downsides to this type of work. The most commonly cited downsides are lack of benefits (like healthcare and paid time off), inconsistent income, and even lower than promised wages.</p>
                     <p class="apps_text">Perhaps the biggest con of all, is the lack of regulation within the gig work industry. Many individuals fall into being reliant on gig work out of necessity rather than choice. And despite the fact that a worker may be putting in full time hours without getting any kind of benefits in return, workers can still see their pay randomly decline at the whims of these companies' algorithms. In addition, a worker reliant on these gig apps may have their account deactivated at any moment, whether it be due to a one-off mistake or a reason that doesn't even make sense.</p>
                     <p class="apps_text">Some cities have taken action to try to regulate this industry. The city of Seattle created a couple of laws to ensure gig workers make minimum wage, as a study by the city found that gig workers made $9.72/hour after business expenses had been accounted for. This is far below the official minimum wage of $19.97/hour. Despite being well intentioned, these laws have had mixed reactions. Businesses have reported decreases in customers, and app workers have reported less available work. Although some gig workers report the law being a net positive for themselves. Some anecdotal and opinionated reporting of more recent events point to these gig work companies as aggresively fighting these laws by increasing their fees to cover their bottom line, but also to possibly make a statement. These laws are currently being looked at to potentially be repealed.</p>

                  <h1 class="about_taital">Searching for More Data</h1>
                  <p class=" about_text">As stated earlier, there are some current struggles around accurately tracking the exact role gig work plays in the overall economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has some information around gig work, though there is no substantial data from within the last several years, and the nature of the gig economy has changed drastically from about 2019 onwards. There are also some individuals and groups who express concern that the BLS's methodologies for gathering data may not end up accurately reflecting the true state of the gig economy (Risher, 2020). The BLS is slated to be releasing a report that hopefully more accurately captures the state of gig work sometime in 2024.</p>
                  <p class=" about_text">From what is available from the BLS, we can see at least a slight increase in the type of work gig work would be classified as. Other sources help give more recent insight into the state of the gig economy. A 2021 study by the Pew Research Center found that the demographic makeup of gig workers are largely people of color. From our class, we've seen that there has been and continues to be plenty of discrimation that economically impacts people of color the worse. And so long as the gig economy is largely unregulated, gig work may very well be serving as another source of income and wealth inequality that disproportionately impacts people of color.</p>

                     <p class="apps_text">For all the negative impacts gig work has, there are still benefits and potential positive impacts to the gig economy. One point of interest related to this is the unemployment rate. The availability of gig work may very well be having an impact on improving unemployment rate. If you're in between jobs and have access to a phone and method of transportation, gig work can be a nice way to temporarily pay the bills and avoid bankruptcy. As per a CNN article (Delouya, 2023): “People who have access to the gig economy borrow less money than people who don't. You can think of it as an alternative to debt for some people — as a way to get through volatile times,” said Louis Hyman, a professor of labor and business at Cornell University. </p>
                     <p class="apps_text">It's clear that there's a general demand for work that doesn't revolve around the typical 9-5 schedule, even if that comes at the cost of some benefits or pay. And gig apps can give very accessible economic opportunity, provided you have a phone and means of transport. What I believe is especially of importance is implementing proper regulations to the gig economy. It's clear that there is already worker exploitation happening from these gig companies. And while I don't know if the exploitative actions of these companies is for the sake of their own survival or for profit padding, I do know that so long as these businesses are legally required to give their shareholders maximum growth, they will all be incentivized to take as much as they can from their gig workers. Proper regulations are imperative for allowing these gig apps to be a means of economic flexibility, rather than another source of inequality.</p>
